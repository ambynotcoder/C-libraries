SMR values are also used as a psychoacoustic metric to determine the perceptual relevance of partials during analysis data postprocessing. The system's noise component is modeled using Bark-scale frequency warping and sub-band noise energy evaluation. Noise energy at the sub-bands is then distributed on a frame-by-frame basis among the partials resulting in a compact hybrid representation based on noise modulated sinusoidal trajectories.
